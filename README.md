**SpeechCloud** 

A tool to convert **speech audio files into a word cloud** representation, 
where the size of words is in some way proportional to their frequency in speech.

Originally developed to visually summarize each episode of [Radio Lockdown](https://radiolockdown.online/#/), a Paris-based webradio organized with some friends to stay in touch during the COVID-19 lockdown.
- Disclaimer #1: the webradio is currently on hold, but all podcasts can be found [here](https://radiolockdown.online/#/podcast)
- Diclaimer #2: all podcasts are in Italian XP
